title: If we leave the UK then we leave the EU, says leading QC
---

![Dads Army](/img/dads-army.jpg) I read Joanna Cherry’s article on the legal issues surrounding Scotland’s continued membership of the EU with interest. It makes no allowance for the fact that Scottish independence would not be welcome to all other Member States. The Spanish Government has already made its position clear by saying "[If Westminster agrees, why should we be against it?](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-politics-scotland/spain-would-not-oppose-future-independent-scotland-rejoining-eu-minister-idUKKCN1NP25P)". I have no doubt that an independent Scotland could in due course become a Member State of the EU. But it would not happen within the timescale, or on the terms, asserted by the Yes campaign, look at [Guy Verhofstadt telling the Home Affairs Committee there is no big obstacle to Scotland joining the EU](https://www.thenational.scot/news/16303810.its-a-simple-fact-top-eu-chief-on-scotland-having-no-big-obstacles-to-eu-entry/) for example.

What is process for removing our EU citizenship? Voting Yes.
