title: WingsScotland endorses BetterTogether candidate
---

![Boris](/img/wings.png) The BetterTogether campaign is happy to receive the endorsement of prominent independence figure and defender of womens rights @wingsscotland. Stuart Cambell who uses money donated by indepence activists to run national polls asking whether trans women can ever really be women has advocated voting for ex Labour leader and BetterTogether founder Johan Lamont due to her "genuine concerns" over transgender people.



Stuart Cambell has long been critical of entryists distracting from independence with personal agendas, so we are extremely happy to receive his endorsement.
